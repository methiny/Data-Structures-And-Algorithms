```
[22,27,16,2,18,6]
[22,16,27,2,18,6]
[16,22,27,2,18,6]  
[16,22,2,27,18,6]  
[16,2,22,27,18,6]

```
## 2) Big-O 
```
Worst Case : O(n^2)
Avarage Case : O(n^2)
Best Case : O(n)
```   
## 3) Time Complexity 

For example, we are looking for 2 in this array. 
```
Worst Case : [27,22,18,16,6,2]
Avarage Case : [6,16,2,18,22,27]
Best Case : [2,6,16,18,22,27]
```
## 4) Which case would 18 suit after the array is sorted? 
```
Average case because 18 is in the middle of the array.
```
## 5) Insertion sort of [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] only first 4 steps.
